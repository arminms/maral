Maral -- Molecular Archiving, Retrieval and Algorithm Library
=============================================================

Maral is a header-only template based C++11 molecular API that only depends on
Boost <http://boost.org>. It simplifies the development and implementation of
algorithms in the field of molecular modelling, computational chemistry and
structural bioinformatics. It utilizes the policy based design along with
template metaprogramming (TMP) technique to optimize the source code at compile
time based on the decisions made by the user.
