Maral Installation Instructions
===============================

    Using the same procedrue below you can build Maral for 
    Linux/Windows/OS X:

    1. Clone from repository:

        $ git clone https://github.com/arminms/maral.git

    2. Create a build directory

       The recommended way to build the library is in a seperate build
       directory, for example within the top-level of the Maral
       package:

        $ cd maral
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build

    3. Configure the library

        $ cmake ..

       or run GUI version (recommended for Windows):

        $ cmake-gui ..

       The latter command will try to locate the necessary libraries. If
       everything is OK, then this should end with something like:

        -- Generating done
        -- Build files have been written to: some-path/maral/build

       If CMake fails, because it cannot resolve all dependencies, then you
       may help CMake by setting some variables to help CMake locate the
       libraries. This may be done on the command-line using -Dvar=value or
       using the interactive program:

        $ ccmake .

       To change any entry, use [Enter]. To save and quit, do [c] followed
       by [g].

    4. Build the binaries

        $ make

       For parallel builds add '-j N', e.g. for building using 4 CPUs use:

        $ make -j 4

       On Windows using native tools (i.e. Visual Studio) use cmake build
       facility:

        $ cmake --build . --config Release

       and for multi-threaded builds use:

        $ cmake --build . --config Release -- //m

    5. Running tests:
    
        $ make
        $ make test

       And on Windows:

        $ cmake --build . --config Release --target run_tests

    6. Install Maral binaries (as user with sufficient permissions):

        $ make install

       And on Windows:

        $ cmake --build . --config Release --target install

       This will install Maral to $INSTALL_PREFIX.

    7. Making CPack install packages:

        $ make package

       And on Windows with NSIS installed:

        $ cmake --build . --config Release --target package
